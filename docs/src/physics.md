HallThruster.jl solves the quasineutral plasma equations of motion for a Hall Thruster along the thruster's channel centerline (the z-axis). We solve seperate models for neutral particles, ions, and electrons. Neutrals are assumed to have (user-configurable) constant velocity and temperature and are tracked by a single continuity equation. Ions are assumed isothermal and unmagnetized. Multiple ion species with different charge states are supported, and each is tracked by a continuity equation and a momentum equation. We employ the drift-diffusion approximation for electrons, which reduces the electron momentum equation to a generalized Ohm's law. Charge conservation is then used to solve for the electrostatic potential. The electron temperature is determined by solving an equation for the conservation of electron internal energy.
